//! The evaluator: detections in, a stable `Vec<Issue>` out.
//!
//! Everything a user sees about what is wrong reads from [`Engine::issues`] —
//! the Diagnose tab, the verdict line under the tab bar on every other tab,
//! the timeline events, the toast, and the exported report. There is exactly
//! one list, so those six surfaces cannot disagree with each other.
//!
//! The engine's real job is *continuity*. A resolver that has been slow for an
//! hour is one issue with a growing window, not 3,600 findings; a resolver
//! that flaps every few minutes is one issue with a recurrence count, not
//! twenty. Detectors are stateless and fire every tick — turning that into a
//! stable, human-sized list of findings happens here.
