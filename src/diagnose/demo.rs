//! `--demo`: the Diagnose tab driven by the recorded scenario instead of the
//! live network.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Diagnose only has something to say when something is wrong, and it needs
//! thirty minutes of baseline before it will say it. That is correct
//! behaviour and it makes the feature impossible to show: a screenshot of a
//! healthy laptop is an empty list, and nobody is going to break their own DNS
//! to evaluate a tool. So the scenario in [`super::fixture`] is replayed
//! through the real engine, the real rules and the real UI — only the
//! observations are recorded rather than measured.
//!
//! ## The rules this mode plays by
//!
//! 1. **It says so, always.** [`DemoDriver::banner`] is rendered in the engine
//!    strip and cannot be turned off. A demo that can be mistaken for live
//!    measurement is worse than no demo.
//! 2. **It touches nothing.** Remediations are simulated, never applied. The
//!    resolver on the host running the demo is not written to, and the
//!    journal is not involved.
//! 3. **It does not cheat the engine.** Applying the fix does not mark the
//!    issue resolved — it changes what the resolver *observes*, and the same
//!    verify condition that governs a live issue (`dns.rtt_p50` under 0.8 of
//!    the line it opened on, which reads `< 5ms` here, held for 60s) is what
//!    closes it. The demo can show the loop closing because the loop actually
//!    closes.
