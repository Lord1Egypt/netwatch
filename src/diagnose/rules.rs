//! The built-in ruleset: what netwatch knows how to recognise, and which
//! findings are consequences of which others.
//!
//! The catalogue is data, not code paths. Each [`Rule`] carries the metadata
//! the UI and the report need — severity, the plain-English trigger, the
//! suppression edges — and declares whether netwatch can currently *evaluate*
//! it ([`RuleStatus`]). A rule netwatch can't yet evaluate is listed as
//! `Planned` and is visible in the ruleset browser, but it can never open an
//! issue. That distinction is the point: a diagnostic tool that lists 24 rules
//! and silently evaluates nine is lying about its coverage.
