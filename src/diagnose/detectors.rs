//! Detectors: live observations in, candidate issues out.
//!
//! Four sources feed one evaluator — baselines, socket verdicts, diffs, and
//! the on-demand pipeline. Each produces a [`Detection`], which is an issue
//! without the parts only the engine can know (its id, when it first opened,
//! how many times it has recurred). The engine merges detections into the
//! issue list, so a condition that persists for an hour stays *one* issue with
//! a growing window rather than 3,600 findings.
//!
//! Every threshold that isn't a physical constant comes from [`Thresholds`],
//! so a user ruleset can retune the engine without touching this file.
