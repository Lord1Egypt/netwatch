//! Per-metric, per-subject baselines: EWMA mean and standard deviation,
//! learned over a minimum window and persisted across runs.
//!
//! ## Why baselines are scoped to a network
//!
//! A baseline is only meaningful on the network it was learned on. Carry a
//! laptop from a 1.2ms office resolver to a hotel hotspot and every
//! baseline-derived rule fires at once — dns, gateway rtt, path, throughput —
//! producing a screen full of red that describes nothing but the fact that the
//! user moved. A persisted `baselines.json` makes that worse, because the
//! wrong baselines survive the reboot too.
//!
//! So every sample is recorded under a [`NetworkFingerprint`] (interface,
//! gateway, resolver set, local subnet). Changing networks doesn't discard
//! anything — the old fingerprint's baselines stay on disk and come back when
//! the user returns to that network — but rules only ever see baselines
//! learned on the network that is currently up, and a freshly-seen network
//! starts in `Learning` where no baseline rule can fire.
