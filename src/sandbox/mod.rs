//! Per-thread Linux filesystem enforcement using a prepared, pinned ruleset.
//! Application worker entry points apply policy before processing; capture
//! prepares its device first. Strict entry failure withholds processing.
//! Main applies the same policy after resource startup. No network restrictions
//! are installed, and macOS/Windows/FreeBSD have no filesystem backend.
//!
//! Selected capability removals are checked after each attempt. Best-effort
//! retains CAP_NET_RAW; strict drops it, so later capture reopening may fail.
//! Worker reports describe policy entry, not an exploit-proof process boundary.
//! The eBPF SDK reader is disabled under an installed sandbox policy until it
//! exposes a suitable entry hook. See docs/runtime-lifecycle.md for limitations.
